Slides from ipv6.pdf
status: done-ish

Notes:
	- skipped slide 17 allocations to ARIN/APNIC/RIPE/... Seems too specific to have to know by heart.
	- skipped subnet-router anycast on slide 19. Deprecated and doesn't sound too relevant anymore, but it's theoretically possible that he asks about it.
	- skipped on slide 20: "fec0::/10 (Site-local addresses; deprecated)" (deprecated) and "fe80::/10 (Link-local addresses)" (should be known)
	- slide 23 I left a few out because I think he'd only ask the important ones.
	- slide 30 ICMPv6 types used for NDP
	- don't understand slide 42 (and skipped the related 43)
	- skipped some of the remaining ones until the last because of various reasons
