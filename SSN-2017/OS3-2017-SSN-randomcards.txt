What is a Zero Knowledge Proof?	Proving that you know a secret without revealing any info about it
What are the five most frequent characters in English, in descending order?	ETAON
How does Atbash work?	A -&gt; Z<div>B -&gt; Y</div><div>C -&gt; X</div>
What is the order of Pigpen?	#-shaped, then # with dots, then X, then X with dots.
How does the Kama-Sutra cipher work?	Randomly pair letters and swap them.
How does the Affine cipher work?	E(x) = (ax+b) mod m<div><br><div>Or: multiply with a, then add b. Mod the result, not intermediately.</div></div>
What is the default Caesar cipher distance?	3
Does Railfence do substitution, transposition or both?	transposition only
What is ABCDE in Railfence with 3 rails?	ADBEC
What's the cipher whose name nobody can remember?	Vigenère. Think of it as visionary -&gt; vigenereh -&gt; vigenère. Or something.
How does the Vigenère cipher work?	With a keyword in addition to the ciphertext. The keyword is repeated to turn into the length of the plaintext. For each character of the plaintext, shift it by the corresponding key character.
How does a digraph cipher work?	Each two character combination turns into another. If you have an uneven number, pad with Xes. Remove spaces.
What does {[message]<sub>bob</sub>}<sub>alice</sub>&nbsp;mean?	Encrypted with Alice's public key, signed with Bob's key. Mnemonic: Square = Sign (and curly = encrypt).
How does DH work?	0. The parameters g (generator) and p (modulus) are given. If you need to come up with example values, pick the number 2 for each.<div>1. Each party generates a random integer (a and b)</div><div>2. They raise the generator to the power of their integer modulo p (A=(g^a)%p, B=(g^b)%p) and send it to the other party.<div>3. Now each party raises the received number to the power of their own random number modulo p, i.e. secret == (A^b)%p == (B^a)%p.</div></div>
What does DH do (what is its purpose)?	A key exchange (KEX).<div><br></div><div>After performing a DH KEX, each party can compute a shared secret. It is, however, unauthenticated, so an additional algorithm is needed for use over insecure channels where an active attacker (as opposed to a passive intercepter) could interfere.<div><br></div><div>It's useful for ephemeral keys because it only requires generating one random integer and performing two operations. Generating RSA keys, for example, is very computationally expensive (relatively speaking).</div></div>
What is PFS?	Perfect Forward Secrecy (or just Forward Secrecy) means that the compromise of a key does not compromise past or future keys. In practice, this means you need to use ephemeral keys (and generate them properly, otherwise you could predict keys given a few compromised keys).
What's the name of that funny World War 1 cipher that was optimized for transmission over telegraph using Morse code?	ADFGVX<div>Mnemonic: asdf is that nice row on your keyboard. Hopfully you remember to drop the s. Then GVX is just the Grote Vriendelijke Xylofoon. Also, the G follows the F on the keyboard so use asdfg, then down, then pad with an X just like in some other old algorithms do. Easy. (...anyone else have better ideas?)</div>
How does ADFGVX work?	Phase 1: Write a square with the algorithm's name on both sides. Fill with the 26 letters and 10 digits at random. Lookup the character to encrypt and write down its coordinates. The resulting coordinate string is your phase 1 ciphertext.<div><br></div><div>Phase 2: write a secret keyword, such as MARK, and write the ciphertext below it (and pad with X) as such:</div><div>MARK<br>AGFX</div><div>XDAD</div><div>GFXX</div><div>Then transpose such that they keyword is in alphabetical order:</div><div>AKMR</div><div>GXAF</div><div>DDXA</div><div>FXGX</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, discard the keyword row and read from top to bottom. Result: GDFXDXAXGFAX.</div>
How to decipher railfence?	<div>Example ciphertext:&nbsp;HLETUODEOAILRLBUFWL</div><div><br></div><div>Guess the number of rails (example: 3) and divide the length of the ciphertext (example: 19) by that number (result: 6.33). If you get a fraction as result, multiply the fractional part (0.33) by the number of rails (3). The resulting number (1) is the number of rails that is 1 longer than the bottom one. Rewrite the ciphertext as rows:</div><div><br></div><div>HLETUOD</div><div>EOAILR</div><div>LBUFWL</div><div><br></div><div>Read top to bottom.</div>
