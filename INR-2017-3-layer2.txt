At which layer does a hub operate and what is another word for it?	Physical; multiport repeater.
What forms a LAN/link segment?	A network connectd by hubs and/or repeaters. Notably *not* switches.
What forms a LAN/link?	A network connected by bridges and/or switches.
What is the difference between hubs and switches, or between repeaters and bridges?	A repeater has a single collision domain; a bridge has a single broadcast domain.
Which sublayers does layer 2 have?	MAC (Media Access Control) and LLC (Logical Link Control). MAC is the lower one and its most important example is Ethernet with CSMA/CD. Ethernet also controle backoff and retransmission. LLC introduces new fields (see another card).
What fields does LLC introduce?	DSAP, SSAP and 1 or 2 control bytes. SAP stands for Service Access Point and D/S for destination/source.
What does the DIX Ethernet / Ethernet II header look like?	- 7 bytes preamble, 1 byte Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)<div>- Destination and source address (2×6 bytes)</div><div>- Type (2 bytes)</div><div>- PDU (perhaps with padding)</div><div>- FCS (CRC)</div>
What's the minimum and maximum size of a PDU in DIX Ethernet?	46 - 1500 bytes
What is the OUI?	Orgizationally Unique Identifier
What bits are special in a MAC address?	I/G bit (individual/group) and U/L (universal/local), the first and second bit on the wire because it is sent in LSB format (least significant bit first), or the last two bits of the first byte.
How can one embed an EUI-48 in EUI-64?	Paste FF:FE in the middle:<div>00:30:65:7E:9D:5E ⇒ 00:30:65:FF:FE:7E:9D:5E<br></div>
How can one embed an MAC-48 in EUI-64?	Paste FF:FF in the middle:<div>00:30:65:7E:9D:5E ⇒ 00:30:65:FF:FF:7E:9D:5E<br></div><div><br></div><div>But since they are obsolete, you can really just do whatever and could paste FF:FE in there as well.</div>
How to put a MAC address, ahem, EUI-64 in an IPv6 address?	Flip the U/L bit (from 0 to 1 in the example). Locally assigned IPv6 addresses do the reverse.
TODO slide 17 you can't do the reverse of a flip + why set the bit to universal when you locally administer it + why skip bits 64-71 when creating a ... a what?	
What are common ethernet types?	0x800 for IP, 0x806 for ARP and 0x86DD for IPv6
What's a no-frill?	A stupid switch, which just copies frames to separate the collision domain. Uses store and forward technique. The opposite is a learning and filtering switch/bridge, which remembers on which port a station resides. This builds a filtering database.
What's a VLAN?	Virtual LAN, where LAN stands for Local Area Network. The ethertype is 0x8100. It separates a physically bridged LAN into multiple logical/virtual LANs.
