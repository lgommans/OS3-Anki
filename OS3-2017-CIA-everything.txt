What is 256 in little-endian hexadecimal?	0x0001<div>If 0xFF is 255 (same as 0x00FF), then 0x0100 is 256. Convert that to little-endian by swapping around whole bytes: 01 00 -&gt; 00 01.</div>
What does the call instruction do?	The call instruction pushes the current code location onto memory, then performs a jump to the code location indicated by the operand. Unlike normal jumps, call saves the location to return to when the subroutine completes.
What does the ret instruction do?	It pops a code location off of the memory stack and returns there. See also the 'call instruction' card.
How can one call a procedure in a shared library?	This will jump outside your own code and you need to follow the calling convention.
What command can be used for following library calls?	ltrace
