# OS3/SNE Anki files

Anki is open source "flash card" software. The decks in this repository are
made to prepare for the exam by questioning you on the material.

## Structure of the repository

Most .txt files will be decks. Only `...-info.txt` contain metadata.

## How to use

Install Anki if you have not already. It is available in the repositories,
but that seems to be broken. Download from <https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download>.

With Ctrl+I (or File -> Import) you can import decks. Use "Allow HTML" when
importing these decks.


## Contributing

To add changes, request write permissions so you can push to the repository.
Export the deck using File -> Export. The format "Cards in Plain Text" is
preferred, but you can use a binary package as well if you have pictures or
something.

Use an `-info.txt` file to comment on a card deck, e.g. give status such as
"todo: architecture slides 44-64".

If your contributions fit in an existing deck, just add them to that deck. Feel
free to remove cards (if you're quite sure they're silly), improve cards,
merge/split cards, etc.
