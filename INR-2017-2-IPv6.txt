How many more addresses are there in IPv6?	2^96. Because (2^128)/(2^32)=2^96.
Why should IPv6 be used?	- Many more addresses<div>- Only 4 times as many bits</div><div>- Autoconfiguration (stateless or stateful)</div><div>- Built-in IPsec for security</div><div>- No NAT needed</div><div>- Optimized headers (fixed length (40 bytes) with extension header mechanism)</div>
"What does ""built-in security"" mean?"	Anyone implementing IPv6 is also required (by the spec, that is---not by the police!) to implement IPSEC. Therefore anyone speaking IPv6 can also speak IPSEC.
What protocol is used in stateful autoconfiguration for IPv6?	DHCPv6
"What is the advantage of ""no NAT needed""?"	The end-to-end principle could be reinstated.
What might move people to use IPv6?	QoS (flowlabel is present in the standard header) and hierarchical routing (nothing new, but we have space to expand again)
What is mixed notation in IPv4?	"A host and network in one notation. You'll probably wonder ""huh, that's just normal notation right?"" and the answer is yes. Something like&nbsp;131.211.140.25/26 where the network is&nbsp;131.211.140.0/26."
Can mixed notation of IPv4 also be used in IPv6	duh
What is the short form of 0000:0000:0130:1000:0001:0000:0000:0001/64?	0:0:130:1000:1::1/64<div><br /></div><div>You can choose yourself where you place the double colon, but there cannot be two double colons. It could also have been ::130:1000:1:0:0::1/64.</div>
What happened to broadcast in IPv6?	This was replaced by multicast.
Name some top level allocations	::/8 special-purpose<div>100::/8 special-purpose</div><div>2000::/3 global unicast</div><div>fc0::/7 unique local unicast</div><div>fe80::/10 link-local (link-scoped) unicast</div><div>ff00::/8 multicast</div>
What is ff00::/8 and 100::/8?	ff00::/8 is multicast and 100::/8 is special-purpose.
What are some addresses in special-purpose space?	"::/128 is ""unspecified address"", like 0.0.0.0 in IPv4.<div><br /></div><div>::1/128 is localhost</div><div><br /></div><div>::a.b.c.d/128 is an IPv4-compatible address (used for automatic tunneling, now deprecated)</div><div><br /></div><div>::ffff:a.b.c.d/128 (from ::ffff:0:0/96) is an IPv4-mapped address (never seen on the wire, only for IPv6-only applications to communicate with v4-only hosts)</div><div><br /></div><div>64:ff9b::/96 is a well-known prefix</div><div><br /></div><div>100::/64 is the discard-only address block</div>"
What does modern algorithmic translation to IPv4 use?	64:ff9b::/96
What is algorithmic translation?	Stateless. Since it's algorithmic, i.e. an algorithm can translate it without needing to look anything up (it just does some computation), it doesn't need state.
What are some of the first global unicast address allocations?	2001::/16 is the first RIR space<div>2002::/16 is 6to4 space</div><div>3ffe::/16 was for 6bone (returned to IANA)</div><div>5f00::/8 6bone (returned to IANA)</div>
What IPv6 allocation is made for documentation purposes?	2001:db8::/32
What is an anycast address?	<div>A single address announced from multiple locations. It will reach only one endpoint. It&nbsp;looks like a normal unicast address (it's allocated from unicast space).</div>
What is Unique Local Unicast?	"The range fc00::/7 is supposed to be subnetted like fdrr:rrrr:rrrr:ssss::/64 where the ""r""s are random bits and ssss is a subnet id. It's fd instead of fc because the ""local bit"" is set to 1. It's designed so companies using such local space can be merged with a very small chance of collisions."
Why is it ff00::/8 instead of ff::/8?	The remaining byte (the zeroes) are used for flags (4 bits) and scope (4 bits).
What flags are used in a multicast address?	The flags are the third nibble (the first zero in ff00::/8). They are 0RPT where:<div>- T=transient (0=permanent)</div><div>- P=prefix-owned</div><div>- R=RP-embedded</div>
What scopes are available in a multicast address?	0 (0000) and f (1111) are reserved.<div>2=link-local</div><div>5=site-local</div><div>e=global</div>
What are the multicast addresses for all nodes, routers (link-local) and routers (site-local)?	ff02::1, ff02::2 and ff05::2
Why does 'ping6 fe80::1' typically not work, assuming there is a node with that address?	You need to specify an interface. In the example of ping6, you can do this using -I (capital i) and many other tools will have similar options, or you need to add %interface to the address, e.g. fe80::1%eth0
What is a sollicited node address?	A multicast address which includes 24 bits of the unicast/anycast address on the interface under consideration. It has the form ff02::1:ffxx:xxxx and is link-local. It is used in Neighbor Solicitation.
What is the traditional unicast allocation hierarchy?	16-16-16-16-64:<div>- /16 RIR space (from IANA)</div><div>- /32 ISP allocations (from RIR)</div><div>- /48 customer allocations (from ISP)</div><div>- /64 customer network (an IPv6 subnet)</div>
What is NDP?	Neighbor Discovery Protocol, used for duplicate address detection / neighbour unreachability detection / discovering network properties / find addresses of neighbours. It makes extensive use of multicast.
What ICMPv6 types are used for NDP?	Router Solicitation, Router Advertisement, Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement, and Redirect Message.
What fields does the IPv6 header have, how long are they and what is their purpose?	Version (4 bits) always 0110 (=6);<div><br /></div><div>Traffic Class (8 bits) 6 bits for Differentiated Services and 2 bits for Explicit Congestion Notification;</div><div><br /></div><div>Flowlabel (20 bits) identifies flows with special requirements;</div><div><br /></div><div>Payload Length (16 bits) including extension headers;</div><div><br /></div><div>Next Header (8 bits) type of following header;</div><div><br /></div><div>Hop Limit (8 bits) forwarding count and loop protection;</div><div><br /></div><div>Source address (128 bits); and</div><div><br /></div><div>Destination Address (128 bits).</div>
What are some transition technologies for IPv4 to IPv6?	6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment)<div><br /></div><div>NAT64 and DNS4</div><div><br /></div><div>DS-Lite (ISP network is IPv6-only, uses v4-in-v6 tunnels and CGNAT)</div><div><br /></div><div>6to4</div><div><br /></div><div>ISATAP and Teredo</div>
